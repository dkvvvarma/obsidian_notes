### Abstract
This report outlines the activities and findings from a one-month internship focused on IT auditing. The initial two weeks were dedicated to learning about IT infrastructure and its operations, while the latter half involved performing Nessus vulnerability scans and Splunk log analysis. This internship aimed to understand the security posture of IT systems and identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.

### Introduction
The internship provided practical exposure to IT auditing, a critical aspect of maintaining and improving organizational security. By performing vulnerability scanning and log analysis, the internship aimed to identify security weaknesses and monitor system activities for potential threats.

### Literature Survey 
Numerous studies highlight the importance of vulnerability management and log analysis in maintaining IT security. Nessus is widely recognized for its comprehensive vulnerability assessment capabilities, while Splunk is renowned for its log management and analysis functionalities. Together, these tools are essential for a robust IT security framework.

### Existing System
The existing system lacked regular vulnerability assessments and systematic log analysis. This gap posed significant security risks, including potential exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities and undetected security incidents.
### Problem Statement
The organization required a systematic approach to identify, assess, and mitigate security vulnerabilities within its IT infrastructure. Additionally, there was a need to enhance log analysis capabilities to detect and respond to potential security incidents promptly.

### Proposed System
The proposed system involves implementing regular Nessus vulnerability scans to identify security weaknesses and using Splunk for comprehensive log analysis. This system aims to provide continuous monitoring and timely detection of vulnerabilities and threats.

### Modeling
The model includes:
1. **Learning Phase**: Understanding IT infrastructure and security principles.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using Nessus to perform periodic scans of the IT environment.
3. **Log Analysis**: Utilizing Splunk to analyze system logs, identify anomalies, and generate alerts for suspicious activities.

### Software Used & Hardware and Software Requirements
**Software Used**:
- Nessus for vulnerability scanning.
- Splunk for log analysis.

**Hardware and Software Requirements**:
- Workstations with sufficient processing power and memory to run Nessus and Splunk.
- Access to organizational IT infrastructure for scanning and log collection.
- Necessary licenses for Nessus and Splunk.

### Testing & Result Analysis
**Testing**:
- Conducted Nessus scans on various IT assets to identify vulnerabilities.
- Analyzed logs using Splunk to detect unusual patterns and potential security incidents.

**Result Analysis**:
- Identified multiple vulnerabilities, categorized based on severity.
- Detected and responded to several security events through log analysis.

### Conclusion & Future Work
The internship successfully demonstrated the importance of regular vulnerability scanning and log analysis in maintaining IT security. Future work involves refining the scanning and analysis processes, integrating additional security tools, and providing continuous training for IT staff.
