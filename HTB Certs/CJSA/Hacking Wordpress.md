## WordPress Overview

https://readmedium.com/hackthebox-hacking-wordpress-skill-assessment-758e0e81648b

Wordpress is most popular open source Content  Management System(CMS) used by 1/3rd of all websites in world. It can be used multiple purposes, such as hosting blogs,forums, e-commerce, project management,document management and much more. WordPress is highly customizable as well as SEO friendly, which makes it popular among companies.It has a large library of extensions called themes and plugins, both free and paid, that can be added to enhance the website. Some examples of plugins are WPForms, a robust contact form, MonsterInsights that interfaces with Google Analytics, and Constant Contact, a popular email marketing service.

WordPress is written in PHP and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as the backend. Many hosting companies offer WordPress as an option when creating a new website and even assist with backend tasks such as security updates.

### What is a CMS?
A CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch (or even know how to write code at all).The CMS does most of the "heavy lifting" on the infrastructure side to focus more on the design and presentation aspects of the website instead of the backend structure.Most CMS' provide a rich [What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor where users can edit content as if they were working in a word processing tool such as Microsoft Word. Users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the webserver either from a management portal or via FTP or SFTP.

A CMS is made up of two key components:

- A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A Content Delivery Application (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.
  
 A good CMS will provide extensibility, allowing you to add functionality and design elements to the site without needing to work with the website code, rich user management to provide fine-grained control over access permissions and roles, media management to allow the user to easily upload and embed photos and videos,and proper version control.When looking for a CMS, we should also confirm that it is well-maintained, receives periodic updates and upgrades, and has sufficient built-in security settings to harden the website from attackers.
 

## WordPress Structure

### Default WordPress File Structure

WordPress can be installed on Windows,Linux or MacOS host.WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at `/var/www/html`.

#### File Structure
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html
├── index.php
├── license.txt
├── readme.html
├── wp-activate.php
├── wp-admin
├── wp-blog-header.php
├── wp-comments-post.php
├── wp-config.php
├── wp-config-sample.php
├── wp-content
├── wp-cron.php
├── wp-includes
├── wp-links-opml.php
├── wp-load.php
├── wp-login.php
├── wp-mail.php
├── wp-settings.php
├── wp-signup.php
├── wp-trackback.php
└── xmlrpc.php
```

### Key WordPress Files

The root directory of WordPress contains files that are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

- `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.
- `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.
- `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
    - `/wp-admin/login.php`
    - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    - `/login.php`
    - `/wp-login.php`

This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.

- `xmlrpc.php` is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).

### WordPress Configuration File

- The `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can be useful in troubleshooting.
  
### Key WordPress Directories
- The `wp-content` folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory `uploads/` is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored. These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  
#### WP-Content
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-content
.
├── index.php
├── plugins
└── themes
```

- `wp-includes` contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.

#### WP-Includes
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-includes
.
├── <SNIP>
├── theme.php
├── update.php
├── user.php
├── vars.php
├── version.php
├── widgets
├── widgets.php
├── wlwmanifest.xml
├── wp-db.php
└── wp-diff.php
```

## WordPress User Roles

There are five types of users in a standard WordPress installation.

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|Administrator|This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code.|
|Editor|An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users.|
|Author|Authors can publish and manage their own posts.|
|Contributor|These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.|
|Subscriber|These are normal users who can browse posts and edit their profiles.|

Gaining access as an administrator is usually needed to obtain code execution on the server. However, editors and authors might have access to certain vulnerable plugins that normal users do not.

##  WordPress Core version Enumeration
It is always important to know what type of application we are working with. An essential part of the enumeration phase is uncovering the software version number. This is helpful when searching for common misconfigurations such as default passwords that may be set for certain versions of an application and searching for known vulnerabilities for a particular version number. We can use a variety of methods to discover the version number manually. The first and easiest step is reviewing the page source code. We can do this by right-clicking anywhere on the current page and selecting "View page source" from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut `[CTRL + U]`.

We can search for the `meta generator` tag using the shortcut `[CTRL + F]` in the browser or use `cURL` along with `grep` from the command line to filter for this information.

#### WP Version - Source Code
```html
...SNIP...
<link rel='https://api.w.org/' href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/' />
<link rel="EditURI" type="application/rsd+xml" title="RSD" href="http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php?rsd" />
<link rel="wlwmanifest" type="application/wlwmanifest+xml" href="http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml" /> 
<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.3.3" />
...SNIP...
```

  WordPress Core Version Enumeration

```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | grep '<meta name="generator"'

<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.3.3" />
```

Aside from version information, the source code may also contain comments that may be useful. Links to CSS (style sheets) and JS (JavaScript) can also provide hints about the version number.

#### WP Version - CSS
```html
...SNIP...
<link rel='stylesheet' id='bootstrap-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex-style-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/style.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex_color-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/colors/default.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='smartmenus-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/jquery.smartmenus.bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
...SNIP...
```

#### WP Version - JS
```html
...SNIP...
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4-wp'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.4.1'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/subscriber.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine-en.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
...SNIP...
```

In older WordPress versions, another source for uncovering version information is the `readme.html` file in WordPress's root directory.

## Plugins and Themes Enumeration

We can also find information about the installed plugins by reviewing the source code manually by inspecting the page source or filtering for the information using `cURL` and other command-line utilities.

#### Plugins
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | sed 's/href=/\n/g' | sed 's/src=/\n/g' | grep 'wp-content/plugins/*' | cut -d"'" -f2

```

#### Themes
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | sed 's/href=/\n/g' | sed 's/src=/\n/g' | grep 'themes' | cut -d"'" -f2

http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/js/jquery.smartmenus.bootstrap.js?ver=5.3.3
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/js/owl.carousel.min.js?ver=5.3.3
background: url("http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/images/breadcrumb-back.jpg") #50b9ce;
```

The response headers may also contain version numbers for specific plugins.

However, not all installed plugins and themes can be discovered passively. In this case, we have to send requests to the server actively to enumerate them. We can do this by sending a GET request that points to a directory or file that may exist on the server. If the directory or file does exist, we will either gain access to the directory or file or will receive a redirect response from the webserver, indicating that the content does exist. However, we do not have direct access to it.

#### Plugins Active Enumeration
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:23 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
Content-Length: 356
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

If the content does not exist, we will receive a `404 Not Found error`.
```shell-session
0xWAYNE@htb[/htb]$ curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/someplugin

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:18 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Link: <http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

The same applies to installed themes.

To speed up enumeration, we could also write a simple bash script or use a tool such as `wfuzz` or `WPScan`, which automate the process.

## Director Indexing

Active plugins should not be our only area of focus when assessing a WordPress website. Even if a plugin is deactivated, it may still be accessible, and therefore we can gain access to its associated scripts and functions. Deactivating a vulnerable plugin does not improve the WordPress site's security. It is best practice to either remove or keep up-to-date any unused plugins.

The following example shows a disabled plugin.

![WordPress plugins list showing 'Mail Masta' with options to activate or delete, and 'Photo Gallery' with option to deactivate.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/17/plugin-deactivated3.png)

If we browse to the plugins directory, we can see that we still have access to the `Mail Masta` plugin.


![Directory listing of /wp-content/plugins/mail-masta showing folders and files including amazon_api, inc, lib, plugin-interface.php, and readme.txt.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/17/plugin-mailmasta2.png)

We can also view the directory listing using cURL and convert the HTML output to a nice readable format using `html2text`.
