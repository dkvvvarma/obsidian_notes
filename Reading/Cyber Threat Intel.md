Cyber threat Intelligence describes the techniques and models used in Cyber Threat Landscape .It consists of survey of ideas, views and concepts rather than the practical hands-on experience. It is open for anyone who wishes to learn about the domain or pursue a career in cyberscape.


CTI is a discipline distinct from other cyber practices such as cyber forensics , malware analysis which revolves around raw information detailing attacks rather provide information to enrich better understanding.

**INTELLIGENCE**


*"The product derived from direct collection and processing of information regarding the environment and capabilities of intentions by actors , in order to identify threats and offer opportunities for exploitation by decision-makers."*
                                                          (NATO 2017a)
   
*"Intelligence is the official, secret collection and processing of information in foreign countries to aid in formulating and implementing foreign policy, and the conduct of covert activities abroad to facilitate the implementation of foreign policy."*
                                                           (Bimfort 1958)

  Intelligence is not exclusive to preserve of state. The private sector also engages in intelligence activities , such as conducting competitive intelligence,  which is defined as
  
    actionable recomendations arising from a systematic process involving planning, gathering , analyzing and disseminating information on the external environment for oppurtunites or developments that have the potential to affect a company's or country's competitive situation*
                                                       (Calof and Skinner 1998)

Competitive Intelligence:

*"A process that increases marketplace competitiveness by analyzing the capabilities and potential actions of individual competitors as well as the overall competitive situation of the firm in its industry in the economy."*
                                                     (Pellissier and Nenzhele 2003)

Across  various disciplines and specializations associated with the notion of 'intelligence ', there are commonalties within definitions in broad  term or in layman's term it can be put together as


- Intelligence is both a process and product.

- The intelligence process consists of gathering information, analyzing this and synthesizing it into a Intelligence product.

- Intelligence products are intended to be used by recipient's in order to assist in decision making.


**Cyber Threat**

Cyber dates back to 1940's was first used in concept of *'cybernetics'* relating to communication and control interfaces between living things and machines

Now-a-days this term is widely associated with security and attacks against computer systems in digital realm. *Cyberspace* refers to the environments outside of normal experience. NATO defines *cyberspace* as
 
 *"The global domain consisting of all interconnected communication, information technology and other electronic systems, networks and their dT, including those which are separated or independent, which process, store or transmit data"*
                                                                (NATO 2017b)

In this digital era the '*Cyber domain*' is a potentially contested space which is equivalent to the traditional military contested environments of  the land, sea, and air. Followed by this logic , in the way army , navy, air force exist the cyber capability is required to defend and project the national interest within the cyber domain.


Threats can be found in the traditional domains of land, sea and air. These threats are diverse in nature, ranging from hostile adversaries that like to cause harm or weather conditions that may damage the military equipment or ships or planes or terrains that may cause difficulties for transport. However, A military commander wishing to operate in any these domains must collect intelligence to understand the threats that may be encountered. This intelligence should be expected to describe where a threat is located, the specific danger that the threat may pose, and how the threat changes over time.

Similarly, The *cyberspace* is no different. within this domain hostile adversaries may be operating, physical features of infrastructure may constrain operations, and software installations may change as frequently as weather. In order to operate on this domain, we must gather intelligence.
